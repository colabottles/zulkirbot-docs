# ZulkirBot Release Notes

---

## v1.4.1 — April 13, 2026

### Improvements v1.4.1

#### Giveaway

`!setcode` now reminds chat that viewers must follow and whisper at `@ZulkirBot` before the giveaway starts to be eligible for prize delivery.

## v1.4.0 — April 13, 2026

### Bug Fixes v1.4.0

#### Permadeath + Flee race condition

Fixed an issue where a player who died in combat could still trigger the `!flee` command. The flee handler now checks the database to confirm the character exists before proceeding, and cleans up any stale fight state.

#### Tavern Brawl fizzle reset

Fixed an issue where `!brawl` could not be started again after a brawl fizzled out due to insufficient participants. `tavernVisitors` is now cleared on brawl cancel and brawl end, and the triggering player is now added via `addParticipant` instead of a direct array push.

#### Weekly reward double-write

Fixed a race condition in `!weekly` where two separate database writes were made, leaving the character in an inconsistent state if the bot restarted between them. Now uses a single atomic update. Also fixed the level-up message not appearing in the weekly reward chat response.

#### Party raid XP missing level recalc

Fixed an issue where defeating a raid boss granted XP to party members but never recalculated or updated their level, causing level/XP desync. Party members now correctly level up after a successful raid.

#### Duplicate item stat negation

Two equipped items with the same name no longer stack stat bonuses. Only the first equipped instance counts toward stats. Players are warned in chat when equipping a duplicate item that the second copy provides no bonus.

### Improvements v1.4.0

#### Equip command

Players can no longer equip an item that is already equipped, preventing the same item from occupying two slots.

#### Code Quality

Removed unused `tmi` import from `flee.ts`
Removed unused `formatClass` import from `party.ts`
Removed unused `getPartyById` import from `party.ts`
Replaced dynamic `await import()` calls in `party.ts` with static top-level imports for `calculateLevel` and `CLASS_HP`
